# Assignment Sanitizer

This script "sanitizes" the files of programming assignment. A programming assignment is easiest to develop if the
solution is developed in tandem with the assignment. However, the solution should *not* exist when given to the students.

Repobee is a set of tools that help instructors develop such assignments. However, the tools are a bit heavyweight and
contains a lot of other functionality that does not fully match my own process, which is why I extracted the assignment
sanitizer part out.
